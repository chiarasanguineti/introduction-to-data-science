The aim of this project is to explore and analyse the datasets provided concerning titles available on streaming platforms, in particular Amazon and Disney.

The main objective is to conduct a comprehensive investigation through the fundamental phases of Data Science, starting with data integration, passing through transformation and exploration, and ending with the application of statistical tests and predictive methods.

We will start our journey by integrating information from different tables and cleaning the data to create a combined dataset. Next, we will perform transformations to make subsequent analyses easier, such as splitting the "date_added" column into "year_added" and "month_added" and creating a "genres_number" column representing the number of genres associated with each title.
In the exploration phase, we will focus on the representation of the distribution of IMDb scores by age certification and the time trend of films and TV shows produced and uploaded on the platforms.
Next, we will apply statistical tests to check for any significant differences between the distributions of films and TV shows according to the year of production and the year of uploading to the platform. 
Finally, we will construct an OLAP representation to count data across the two platforms by age, type (film or TV show) and country of production.
We will conclude our exploration by applying supervised predictive methods, using a descriptor composed of several variables to predict the category of a title (FILM or TV SHOW). The testing phase will be performed on data from a different platform than the one used for training.

Through these steps, we aim to gain an in-depth understanding of the data and provide useful insights into the dynamics of content on the Amazon and Disney streaming platforms.
